Using SSH for Multiple Accounts
If you need to use multiple GitHub accounts, it's often easier to manage them using SSH. Here's how you can set it up:

01 . Generate SSH Keys for Both Accounts:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_localcarz
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "another-email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_carbazar

    Add the SSH Keys to Your SSH Agent:
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_localcarz
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_carbazar

    Add the localcarz SSH key to your GitHub account:
    Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys.
    Add the public keys (~/.ssh/id_rsa_localcarz.pub and ~/.ssh/id_rsa_carbazar.pub) to the respective GitHub accounts.
    make new SSH key and paste here mentioned copied ssh & follow 04 step

    Copy the SSH key for localcarz to your clipboard:
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa_localcarz.pub

    and copy full text (ssh to .com ) & follow 03 step

    Edit the SSH config file:
    nano ~/.ssh/config

    N:B use ctrl+x to exit and ctrl+c to exit

    Add the following configuration
    Host github-localcarz
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_localcarz:

    Save and exit the editor:

    In nano, press CTRL + X, then Y, then ENTER.

    Update your Git remote URLs to use SSH:
    git remote set-url origin git@github-localcarz:Arifmehdi/scrapfiler.git

    Try pushing the changes again:
    git push -u origin main

And enjoy your journey . Thanks for keep with me
